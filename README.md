## Closure

-   a nested function that access variables from the outer function!!!

## Callback

-   is an argument that is a function

### does it have to be an arrow function?

Nope!

### does it have to be an anonymous function?

Sometimes...

## Promises

-   for organizing asynchronous code
-   they solve the problem of "callback HELL"

    -   aka working with deeply nested callback functions

-   it's an object
-   with a .then() fn
    -   pass it a callback fn
-   and it has a .catch() fn

-   it's an object
-   it exists in one of three states
    -   pending
    -   fulfilled
    -   rejected

### How do I wait for a bunch of Promises to finish?

Use `Promise.all()`, which will "await" for an Array of Promises to finish.
